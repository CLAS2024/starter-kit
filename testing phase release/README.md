This is the starter kit for The Competition for LLM and Agent Safety 2024, a NeurIPS 2024 competition. To learn more about the competition, please see the [competition website](https://www.llmagentsafetycomp24.com/). Starter kits for individual tracks are in the `jailbreaking_attack_track`, `backdoor_trigger_recovery_for_model`, and `backdoor_trigger_recovery_for_agent` folders. Please see the README in those folders for instructions on downloading data, running baselines, and generating submissions. (We will release `backdoor_trigger_recovery_for_model` very soon.)
